Sonar-Based Underwater Object Classification Using ML

Objective
The goal is to distinguish between metallic objects and rock formations submerged underwater using sonar data. The classification process is complicated by environmental noise, signal distortions, and the overlapping frequency responses of different objects. This project employs noise reduction, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction techniques to improve the classification performance.

Problem Statement
Sonar Reflections: Different objects produce varying reflection patterns, making classification challenging.
